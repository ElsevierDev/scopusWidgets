# Scopus Widgets
This repository provides examples of integration with Scopus using API or simple URL inward links.

They are currently organized into two groups:
* **inwardSearch**: contains an example of HTML snippet to integrate in any web site allowing users to trigger a Scopus document search, for example from a Library Portal
* **tableau**: contains a Tableau software component called "Web Data Connector" allowing users to pull data from Scopus API directly in their Tableau projects
